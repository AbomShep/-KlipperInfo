# Welcome to klipper.info!

{% hint style="info" %}
Discord Server link: [https://discord.klipper3d.org/](https://discord.klipper3d.org/)

{% hint style="warning" %}
It's important to read all of the articles in the [/docs folder](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/tree/master/docs) in the klipper distribution. There's too much information to repeat here, and it's all useful!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
We got the logo from a github thread where people have been discussing possible logos.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
We've removed the sections that were meant to guide you in installing Klipper, Octoprint and DWC2. Things have changed dramatically, and frankly none of us have the time to keep this current. In additon, these have become easier to install now. The rest of the sections will remain, and we are always willing to help at the discord server!
{% endhint %}

We add to this as often as we find something useful. If you have comments or suggestions, feel free to join our discord and let us know! Or email us at abomshep@gmail.com
