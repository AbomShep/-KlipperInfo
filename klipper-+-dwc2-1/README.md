  DWC2 is a version of the Duet Web Controller adapted for use as a UI for
  Klipper. It's an alternative to Octoprint and far superior to Octoprint in our
  opinion.

# Klipper + DWC2

What you'll need

1. Raspberry Pi \(3 is preferred\)
2. MicroSD Card 4gb in capacity or greater
3. [Putty](https://putty.org/) or other  method of connecting via ssh

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are moving from an existing klipper installation, make a copy of your printer.cfg file. Everything but the saved configuration information at the bottom can be reused.
{% endhint %}
