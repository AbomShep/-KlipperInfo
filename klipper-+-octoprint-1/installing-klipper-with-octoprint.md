# Installing Octoprint

### Why Octoprint? 

Octoprint offers many features and plugins that make it easier to manage your print jobs It also has a plugin called OctoKlipper that allows you to manage Klipper's printer.cfg file without have to ssh into the Raspberry Pi with putty.

### Why not Octoprint?

It is also marked by slow boot times, and some awkwardness in situations like canceling a print.

### What you'll need

A Raspberry PI and a microSD card at least 4gb in capacity.

### Install Octoprint

Use the following URL to install Octoprint.

​[https://octoprint.org](https://octoprint.org)

### Add the Klipper Plugin

From the plugin manager, search for [Octoklipper](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/klipper/) and install. It will ask you to reset octoprint when you're done. This will make managing klipper easy and  convenient from within Octoprint.

#### More Plugins

[Teaching Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq1sFBgxy8o) has a good video on The Best Octoprint Plugins. We can't recommend [Themify](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/themeify/) enough.

### Useful Resources

​[Chris Riley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_541iD5Bj0) has a very good tutorial on installing both Octoprint and Klipper.
