{% hint style="warning" %}
You'll need to add an additional section to your printer.cfg file for each stepper that is using a Trinamic Driver. Currently, Klipper can use TMC2130, 2208, 2224 and 2660 drivers. Follow the  directions at [https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/blob/master/config/example-extras.cfg](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/blob/master/config/example-extras.cfg)
